T4

Welcome to the Tap Twist Tunes project.

Run this the first time:

`git clone https://github.com/zaclolz/T4.git`

to add files youve changed for commital

`git add .`

This will add all changed files. Then run

`git commit -m "Enter the changes you made here"`

This will commit the files. But for it to really matter, you need to run

`git push -u origin master`

This will send all files to the server.

Also to get the latest changes, run: 

`git pull`
